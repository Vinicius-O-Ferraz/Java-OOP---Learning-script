# Java-OOP Learning-script

# Introduction
This repository aims to document my Java studies over the course of 6 weeks. Here, I will introduce important programming concepts and develop some simple projects. The content of this repository will be divided into three sections, each lasting 2 weeks. You can see more about this mind map below:

Before discussing OOP and our project, it might be helpful to briefly explore the evolution of programming paradigms. This is a significant part of the history of technology. However, feel free to skip it if you're not interested.

The evolution of programming languages reflects the continuous effort to make software development more efficient, maintainable, and aligned with real-world problems.

## Low-Level Programming:
In the early days, programming was done in machine code or assembly language, which interacted directly with hardware. These languages are fast but complex, requiring detailed knowledge of system architecture.

## Linear Programming:
As computing progressed, simple sequential programming emerged, where instructions were executed one after another. This style lacked structure, making programs difficult to modify and prone to errors as they grew in size.

## Structured Programming:
In the 1960s, structured programming introduced concepts like loops, conditionals, and subroutines, aiming to reduce code complexity. Languages like C adopted this paradigm, promoting readability and maintainability.

## Modular Programming:
To manage large codebases, modular programming divided programs into independent modules. Each module could be developed and tested separately, fostering reusability and collaboration. Languages like Modula-2 and Ada championed this style.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
In the 1980s and 1990s, OOP emerged with languages such as Smalltalk and Java, reflecting real-world entities as objects. OOP promotes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it easier to model complex systems and encouraging code reuse.
